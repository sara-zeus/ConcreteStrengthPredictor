# My Keras Project: Predicting with Neural Networks

Welcome to my Keras project! I've been tinkering with Keras, a cool tool that helps me make models to predict stuff. Whether it's guessing prices or forecasting trends, these models are like crystal balls for data!

## What I've Done

I've made a special notebook called `Regression_Models_with_Keras.ipynb`. It's like a roadmap through my project. I've explained each step so you can see how these prediction models work. 

## What's Exciting

- **Easy Explanations**: I've made it simple, so even if you're new to this, you can understand it.
  
- **Try It Out**: You can play with the models yourself! Just follow along with the notebook.

## How You Can Join In

1. **Get the Goodies**: Grab a copy of my project using `git clone https://github.com/sara-zeus/NeuralNetwork.git`.

2. **Notebook Exploration**: Open the `Regression_Models_with_Keras.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. **Run the Magic**: Click play on the code parts to see the models in action.

## What You Need

- Python 3.x
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
